174;Worldenergy SA;Greenconnector;Greenconnector is an HVDC interconnector project between Italy and Switzerland for power transport using DC cables rather than overhead lines. The route length is about 150 km. The design power is 1000 MW (1200 MW in overload condition), while the DC voltage is +/- 400 kV DC. Two cables will be installed, working with a bipolar scheme. Great part of the cables route will exploit a section of an existing oil pipeline, no longer in service since January 1997. This pipeline crosses the Italian and Switzerland border at Splügenpass and is running close by the two end stations of the Greenconnector project (Sils in Graubunden Canton and Verderio Inferiore, Lecco). The cables will be pulled inside the pipeline itself, reducing the amount of civil works required before and after cable laying and therefore limiting even temporary environmental impact. For about 47 km the cables will run across the Como lake.;1014;Greenconnector;Verderio;Sils i.D.;Underground Cable;DC;400;2022;In Permitting;Terna;Swissgrid;Italy;Switzerland;

The reinforcement strategy consists of maximizing the potential of the 400kV interconnector Lonny-Achene-Gramme (1 circuit) through the use of cost-efficient technologies such as PSTs and HTLS as well as the possibility to rebuild Lonny-Achene-Gramme as a 2-circuit solution. The bilateral study will determine the appropriate implementation option and phasing of this implementation (for example: first install a PST, then upgrade the line capacity), taking into account 1) the interaction between the 400kV interconnectors Avelin-Avelgem-Horta & Lonny-Achene-Gramme in optimizing interconnection capacity  2) the required time to implement the solution  3) that by 2025 Lonny-Achene-Gramme is a structural bottleneck due to the planned nuclear phase out in Belgium";1008;Study Lonny-Achene-Gramme;Lonny (FR);Gramme (BE);Phase Shift Transformer;AC;400;2025-2030;Under Consideration;RTE;ELIA;France;Belgium;

293;Kykladika Meltemia SA;Southern Aegean Interconnector;"The project refers to the construction of a submarine DC transmission link to connect the licensed RES plants at the South Aegean Sea to mainland Greece and the islands of Crete, Kos and the Dodecanese. The main link will be an HVDC link connecting the island of Levitha to both the metropolitan area of Athens and the island of Crete; the 400kV substation at Lavrion area will
be the connection point in the Athens area and Korakia will be the connection point in Crete (located in the north coast).
Both links will consist of two parallel cables in order to increase the reliability of each link; two converter stations are
foreseen in Levitha and relevant converter stations in Lavrion and Korakia. Illustrative routing of the links is shown in the
attached Entso-e map. The capacity of each link will be 600 to 800MW both directions using HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) technology. VSA conversion technology in conjunction with plastic (XLPE) cables will be used.
The licensed  RES projects consist of wind and solar power plants located on 23 small uninhabited islands. The link will be
used for transmitting electricity from the RES plants mentioned above to the mainland and the island of Crete. More
specifically, the power produced in each island will be transferred to the island of Levitha where the main conversion
station will be built acting as a hub.
These connections (with the other islands) will be AC submarine cables (150 kV or 220 kV). 

The connection to Crete gives further possibilities for power transmission to Cyprus and further to Israel through the
""EuroAsia Interconnector"" (already accepted as a PCI by the E.C.). It is also possible to further extend this link to the main
islands of the Dodecanese complex (namely Kos, Leros, Kalymnos, Nisyros, Tilos) in order to allow the supply of these
islands and at the same time the supply of a  complex of other smaller islands already connected to the main ones. This is
a short link (10km to 15km long) and more likely it will be an AC one.

All the installations on  the islands (converter  stations, substations etc) will be of closed type using GIS technology.
The project increases the transfer capacity between Mainland Greece and Crete-Kos Islands and further on to Cyprus
(through EuroAsia Interconnector). The project will provide the system with 1.9 TWh/year wind energy.

On the offshore hub, interconnection capacity between these countries is created by connecting the transport capacity between the hub and countries in a ""copper plate"" type installation.

TenneT Netherlands, TenneT Germany, Energinet and Gasunie joined forces to develop a large scale European electricity system for offshore wind in the North Sea. The North Sea Wind Power Hub (NSWPH) consortium partners consider the project to be an important possible alternative path of internationally coordinated roll-out towards accomplishing the green energy transition and achieving the Paris Agreement. By developing the North Sea Wind Power Hub project, the NSWPH consortium endeavours to make the energy transition both feasible and affordable.

Central to the vision is the construction of one or more hubs at a suitable location in the North Sea with interconnectors to bordering North Sea countries. The whole system may function as a hub for transport of wind energy, an interconnection hub to the connected countries, a working hub for offshore wind developers and a location for possible Power to Gas solutions. As such the NSWPH infrastructure offers benefits by optimizing integration costs of offshore wind, increasing socio-economic welfare by further integrating energy markets, supporting security of supply at wider regional level, and providing potential for innovative power-to-gas concepts to optimize system energy costs.";1504;Power Link Island;0;0;Substation;AC;0;2035-2040;Under Consideration;TenneT-NL, Energinet, TenneT-DE;TenneT-NL, Energinet, TenneT-DE;Netherlands;denmark;Germany
