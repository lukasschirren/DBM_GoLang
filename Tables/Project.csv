be the connection point in the Athens area and Korakia will be the connection point in Crete (located in the north coast).
Both links will consist of two parallel cables in order to increase the reliability of each link; two converter stations are
foreseen in Levitha and relevant converter stations in Lavrion and Korakia. Illustrative routing of the links is shown in the
attached Entso-e map. The capacity of each link will be 600 to 800MW both directions using HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) technology. VSA conversion technology in conjunction with plastic (XLPE) cables will be used.
The licensed  RES projects consist of wind and solar power plants located on 23 small uninhabited islands. The link will be
used for transmitting electricity from the RES plants mentioned above to the mainland and the island of Crete. More
specifically, the power produced in each island will be transferred to the island of Levitha where the main conversion
station will be built acting as a hub.
These connections (with the other islands) will be AC submarine cables (150 kV or 220 kV). 

The connection to Crete gives further possibilities for power transmission to Cyprus and further to Israel through the
""EuroAsia Interconnector"" (already accepted as a PCI by the E.C.). It is also possible to further extend this link to the main
islands of the Dodecanese complex (namely Kos, Leros, Kalymnos, Nisyros, Tilos) in order to allow the supply of these
islands and at the same time the supply of a  complex of other smaller islands already connected to the main ones. This is
a short link (10km to 15km long) and more likely it will be an AC one.

TenneT Netherlands, TenneT Germany, Energinet and Gasunie joined forces to develop a large scale European electricity system for offshore wind in the North Sea. The North Sea Wind Power Hub (NSWPH) consortium partners consider the project to be an important possible alternative path of internationally coordinated roll-out towards accomplishing the green energy transition and achieving the Paris Agreement. By developing the North Sea Wind Power Hub project, the NSWPH consortium endeavours to make the energy transition both feasible and affordable.

Central to the vision is the construction of one or more hubs at a suitable location in the North Sea with interconnectors to bordering North Sea countries. The whole system may function as a hub for transport of wind energy, an interconnection hub to the connected countries, a working hub for offshore wind developers and a location for possible Power to Gas solutions. As such the NSWPH infrastructure offers benefits by optimizing integration costs of offshore wind, increasing socio-economic welfare by further integrating energy markets, supporting security of supply at wider regional level, and providing potential for innovative power-to-gas concepts to optimize system energy costs."

350;South Balkan Corridor;MEPSO;"Тhis project consists of three investments: one 400 kV OHL Bitola(MK)- Elbasan(AL), and two 400 kV SS Ohrid and Kumanovo, in Macedonia. 
The interconnection contributes to increasing the transmission capacity in the East-West direction.
Мentioned two SS-s  will increase the security of supply in the SouthWest part of the FYR of Macedonia.
Construction of 400 kV OHTL interconnection from SS Bitola 2 to Macedonian/Albanian border and SS 400/110 kV Ohrid
400 kV interconnection transmission line Bitola (Macedonia) - Elbasan (Albania) is the last part of the implementation of the Corridor 8 in the context of creating a corridor East-West power transmission corridor between Bulgaria, Macedonia, Albania and Italy."

377;Upgrade BE-NL interconnector VanEyck-Maasbracht;Elia, TENNET-NL;"This study envisions an upgrade of the existing interconnector VanEyck-Maasbracht between Belgium and the Netherlands making use of PSTs and/or HTLS technology.

The study will determine the appropriate implementation option and timing, taking into account
- The already planned upgrade of  the Zandvliet-Rilland interconnector on the BE-NL border (see project 262)
- The synchronisation with project study to upgrade interconnection DE-NL, also currently under consideration (see project 256)"
